# election_inflation_analysis
Project analyzing relationship between inflation and the results of the 2024 US election, for the presidential and downballot races.


In particular, we're interested in matching MSA-level cumulative inflation under President Biden to swings towards President Trump from 2020 to 2024. We also look at downballot elections and the extent to which downballot Democratic candidates were outrunning President Trump.
